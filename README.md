# Permutationally_Symmteric_System_Solver
This project is to develop a python code that can help us to simulate permutationaly symmetric open quantum systems.

The theoretical foundation of the code is take from the thesis of Michael Gegg. [Michael Gegg. Identical Emitters, Collective Effects and Dissipation in Quantum
Optics: Novel Numerical Approaches for Quantum Master Equations. Technische
Universitaet Berlin (Germany), 2017.]
